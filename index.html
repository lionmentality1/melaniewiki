  <h2>Basic background information</h2>

  <p>
    Melanie Kirwa (born November 1972) is a Canadian educator and author specializing in Organizational Communication
    and international education. She was born in the small town of Renfrew, Canada.
  </p>

  <p>
    She is affiliated with HAMK University of Applied Sciences, where she serves in mentorship and supervisory roles,
    including working as a teacher tutor and a thesis language specialist.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to her work in higher education, Kirwa has entrepreneurial experience as a former owner of a language
    training firm serving the Finnish business sector. She has also co-authored five published children’s books, reflecting

    <section id="style" class="section">
  <h2>Leadership style</h2>

  <p>
    The supportive and people-oriented leadership style of Melanie Kirwa is communicated, trusted, and created through a calm
    environment within the classroom. Rather than using an authoritarian style of control over her students, she provides them
    with clear guidance and allows them to feel secure in their abilities.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to communicating, trusting, and creating a calm environment with her students, she is also flexible. She adjusts
    her approach to accommodate various levels of student learning (adult and child), and she uses different methods of delivery
    based on the type of students she is working with. She creates a positive learning environment for all students, paying attention
    to their cultural differences and ensuring that they all feel comfortable and included.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lastly, she demonstrates her leadership style by "leading through example." She listens carefully before responding,
    communicates clearly, and uses respectful communication toward others regardless of different opinions. As a result,
    her students are more open, participate more in their classes, and have less fear of making mistakes.
